This program consists of two client-server pairs of programs, one implementing TCP and the other UDP. 

TCP: 
The server is started first. It creates a new socket on which it then begins to listen. 
The client is then started, which creates its own socket and attempts to connect to the server. 
When the server recieves the connection from the client, it accepts and prepares to recieve data using a data stream. 
The client sends the number inputted by the user to the server, which verifies that it is a valid input. 
If it is not a valid input, it returns a message saying so. 
If it is, it calculates the sum of its digits and returns it to the client, which recieves it and prints it 
to the terminal. 
The server then enters a loop where it continually calculates the sum of each new values' digits and returns it to 
the client until the sum is only one digit. 
Meanwhile, the client is in a similar loop where it receives new messages from the server until the value recieved
is only one digit. 
Finally, once the sum is only one digit, both the client and the server recognize this, close their connection to
each other, and terminate. 

UDP: 
The process of connecting and communicating between the client and the server is very similar to TCP, with the only
difference being that the data is sent in datagrams as opposed to a data stream.
